# Documentation

**Koala Framework consists of two independent parts:**
* Kwf: create web applications using the power of ExtJS and Zend Framework
* Kwc (or CMS): create websites backed by a powerful CMS

Kwc relies heavily on Kwf for all of its backend.

The Documentation is also split in those two parts.

The Koala Framework Documentation is work in progress. 
We are constantly working on improving it but expect rough edges and partially finished contents.
