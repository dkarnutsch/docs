#SASS

Koala Framework supports [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), a css preprocessor which makes styling fun again. If you want to use SASS in your Project you have two options:

1. You can add a `Component.scss` file to every component
2. You can add `.scss` files as dependency for components or for the web

Koala Framework only supports the scss syntax, it does not support the sass syntax or `.sass` files.
