#SASS

Koala Framework supports the css framework Sass, which makes css coding fun again. If you want to use it in your Project you have two options:

1. You can add to every component a Component.scss file
2. You can add .scss files as dependency for components or for the web

Koala Framework do only support the scss syntax, not the sass syntax/files.
