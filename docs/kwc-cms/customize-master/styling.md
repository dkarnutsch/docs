#STYLING MASTER

To change the styling of a master modify Master.tpl and Master.scss.

`Master.scss` must contain the styles for positioning and sizing the elements created in `Master.tpl`. It must not contain styles for content of box components - this has to be done in the individual components.

Master styling is usually done using [susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) to get responsive grids.
