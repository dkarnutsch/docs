#KWC_MAIL_COMPONENT

This component is used for editable e-mails. For example the newsletter component uses it.

The component exists in the component tree although it is not necessarily accessible in the frontend.

Customizing a component can be done just like for any other component. 
The [styling](kwc-mail-component/styling.md) is a bit different as mails require different Html.
