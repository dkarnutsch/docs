#NEWSLETTER

The Newsletter functionality of Koala Framework is implemented using components. For editing the content the paragraphs component plus text image 
already gives you a basic newsletter. Of course it is possible to create custom specialized components as well.

For a short overview of the newsletter visit the [about page](http://www.koala-framework.org/about/newsletter).
