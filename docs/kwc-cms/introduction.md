#INTRODUCTION TO KWC (KOALA WEB COMPONENTS)

The goal of Kwc is to create a CMS (classical frontend that get's edited in a backend) by providing re-usable components.

The Kwc backend is implemented using Kwf (Zend+ExtJS). The Kwc frontend is implemented from scratch for performance 
and flexibility reasons.

##Components

A component is the smallest piece of a frontend page. One page consists of many components:

* **page component:** main component shown in the content area of the page. Typically Paragraphs 
  (that allow any combination of other components)
* **content:** text, image, image enlarge
* **menus**
* **header** (eg. image for logo)
