#CUSTOMIZE MASTER

The component class of a page is the central (or main) content of page. For example paragraphs containing text.

Everything surrounding that central part is created by the so called "master" which consists of a Master Template and Master styles.

The Master Template can embed so called "boxes" - which are ordinary components created by a box generator. That allows using any component as box.

##Location & Inheritance

The Master Template is inherited for all child pages, thus normally the Master Template is can be found at the Root Component.
