#LAYOUT CONTEXTS

When using susy grid in a component you don't always have all grid columns as the component is nested in another component.

In Koala Framework we call that "layout context"

####A component can specify supported layout contexts which will:

* trigger an error when rendering it in a unsupported context
* won't show the component in paragraphs admin for adding
