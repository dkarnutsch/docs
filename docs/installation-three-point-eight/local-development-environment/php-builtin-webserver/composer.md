#INSTALL COMPOSER

Koala Framework utilizes [Composer](composer.md) to manage its dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to /usr/local/bin to use it globally on your system. 

For more information see the official [installation documentation.](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
