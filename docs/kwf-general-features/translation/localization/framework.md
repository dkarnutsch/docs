#LOCALIZE KOALA-FRAMEWORK

Koala-framework 3.9+ uses po-files for translation. Translation of the framework and related repositories is managed 
via [lingohub](https://lingohub.com/).

If you want to provide a new translation for koala-framework just send your translated po-file attached on an github issue. 
Or if you want to translate it via lingohub we can add you as a translator.

We recommend to create a lingohub account and do the translation directly via lingohub interface.
