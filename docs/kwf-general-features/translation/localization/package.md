#LOCALIZE SUPPLEMENTARY PACKAGE

To localize your package you can create a project on lingohub and configure to push changes directly into your repository or do add them manually to your package.

You can also add our lingohub user to your project and benefit of our autoload feature of trl.koala-framework.org

It's also possible to translate po files with poedit or qtlinguist but you still need to add your files to your package.
