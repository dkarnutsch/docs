#CREATE A LINGOHUB PROJECT

To translate your static web texts you need some tool to translate your webcode-language po file into other supported languages. 
One tool is lingohub.

Go to [lingohub.com](https://lingohub.com/) and create a new project. Select `"Gettext (po) (.po)"` as your framework. 
Upload your webcode-language po file as source file.

Now upload your other po-files as new resource-files to provide existing translations.
