#LOCALIZATION

It is the process of adapting internationalized software for a 
specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

This has to be done for three different types:

* [Web](localization/web.md)
* [Package](localization/package.md)
* [Framework](localization/framework.md)
